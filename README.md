# scripts
Just some random scripts I made to make my life easier.

These were designed for Kali Linux. But you can use them on any distro. Thats why I made a couple update scripts for ```dnf``` (Fedora) and ```pacman``` (Arch). Once in a while I use them, so I made some quick scripts just to shorten the amount of typing required to update.
