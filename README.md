# scripts
Just some random Bash scripts I made to make my life easier.

These were designed for Kali Linux. But you can use them on any distro. Thats why I made a couple update scripts for ```dnf``` (Fedora) and ```pacman``` (Arch) as well. Once in a while I use those distros, so I made some quick scripts just to shorten the amount of typing required to update. I will be adding more as I find ways to save myself time on repetitive tasks.

Feel free to suggest others or send me a pull request if you would like to add to it.
